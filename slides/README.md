## About

The slides are all written in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) framework (an R wrapper to [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/)).

The theme used is my own, available here: <https://github.com/janusvm/xaringan-css>.

## Usage

When in a presentation:

- use the arrows keys to navigate slides
- press the `P` key to toggle Presenter Mode, which reveals additional notes to each slide
- press the `?` key to list all available keyboard shortcuts
