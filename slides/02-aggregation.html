# Summarising data

computing a single result from a set of input values

???

To summarise data means to calculate aggregate results from many rows into few or a single row.

---

## What is a summary?

```sql
 SELECT summary_function(expr) [AS new_name] [, ... ] FROM table
[ GROUP BY grouping_variables ]
```

.pull-left[

A _summary function_ aggregates a set of values into one single value (summary)

![:center 95%](input/figs/summary-function.png)
]

.pull-right[

Use the `GROUP BY` clause to create summaries on a by-group basis

![:center 95%](input/figs/grouped-summary.png)
]

.footnote[

]


???
More often than not, you don't want to pull out data as-is from your database, but rather calculate some summaries exposing some insight.

The basic syntax for that is as shown: in the column list of `SELECT`, you make calls to so-called _summary functions_, optionally grouping the input values by one or more variables.


---

## Summary functions

.pull-left[
- `count(*)`: the number of input rows
- `count(expr)`: the number of rows where `expr` is not null
- `avg(expr)`: the average of the input values
- `sum(expr)`: the sum of the input values
- `max(expr)`: the maximum input value
- `min(expr)`: the minimum input value
]

.pull-right[
- `bool_and(expr)`: true if all input values are true
- `bool_or(expr)`: true if at least one input value is true
- `corr(Y, X)`: correlation coefficient between X and Y
- `stddev(expr)`: standard deviation of input values
- `variance(expr)`: variance of input values
]

.footnote[
Many more are available, see the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)
]

???
Here is a quick overview of some of the summary functions that you'll likely need to use.

Many more are available.

---

## Filtering on summaries: the HAVING clause

- `WHERE`: filter using a condition on individual rows, before grouping
- `HAVING`: filter using a condition on aggregations, after grouping

???
When you work with grouped data, you may wish to filter on either individual rows or groups.
The `WHERE` clause, which you saw last time, does the former, and the `HAVING` clause does the latter.

--

```sql
SELECT carrier, count(*) FROM flights
 WHERE origin = 'JFK'
 GROUP BY carrier
HAVING min(distance) &gt; 1000;
```

The carriers whose flights from JFK airport all fly at least 1000 miles to reach their destinations, and their respective number of flights

???
Here is a small example of the usage of `HAVING`.

--

Syntax rule of thumb:

- `WHERE` goes _before_ `GROUP BY` (filter before grouping)
- `HAVING` goes _after_ `GROUP BY` (filter after grouping)

# Combining data from different tables

how to use the JOIN clause

---

## What is a join?

.pull-left[

`JOIN`: clause for combining relations.

.footnote[.pull-left[
In the examples in this section of the slides (which I've borrowed from [r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)), the tables used are:

- `x`, with columns: `key` and `val_x`
- `y`, with columns: `key` and `val_y`
]]
]

.pull-right[

```sql
x JOIN_TYPE y [ JOIN_CONDITION ]
```

![:center 40%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/master/diagrams/join-setup.png)

.center[⬇️]

![:center 50%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/master/diagrams/join-setup2.png)

]

???

An SQL `JOIN` clause is an instruction to combine columns from several tables in a database.

The code snippet should be read as:
"Join `x` and `y` together with `JOIN_TYPE` optionally conditioning on `JOIN_CONDITION`"

On the following slides, we'll look at the concrete `JOIN_TYPE` and `JOIN_CONDITION` you can use.
The figures for the different types of joins will use dots and lines to denote the data that will be returned.

---
## Cross join

`x CROSS JOIN y` ➡️ cartesian product of the rows in `x` and `y`

```sql
SELECT * FROM x CROSS JOIN y;

SELECT * FROM x, y;
```

If

- `x` has dimensions `\(n_x \times m_x\)`, and
- `y` has dimensions `\(n_y \times m_y\)`,

then their cross product has dimensions `\(n_x n_y \times (m_x + m_y)\)`

???

The official PostgreSQL documentation groups the types of joins into two:

- cross join
- qualified join

The `CROSS JOIN` between `x` and `y` is simply the table you get by taking all columns of both and return all possible combinations of rows

---

## Qualified joins

```sql
SELECT * FROM x { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN y ON boolean_expression;
SELECT * FROM x { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN y USING ( join column list );
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN y;
```

???

In contrast to the cross join, the _qualified joins_ only return rows from the two tables which are considering to be "matching", given some condition that evaluates to a boolean value.

The code snippet shown is from the documentation, and it should be read like this:

- For elements in braces `{ ... | ... }`, exactly one of the candidates (delimited by a `|`) must be present
- Elements in brackets `[ ... ]` are optional
- Each row in the snippet corresponds to a different way of specifying the join condition

---

## Qualified joins: INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT * FROM x JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x INNER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL JOIN y;
```

.pull-left[
![:center 90%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/master/diagrams/join-inner.png)
]
.pull-right[
![:center 90%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/master/diagrams/join-one-to-many.png)
]

???

An `INNER JOIN` is the join that selects records found in both `x` and `y`.

That means, that for each row of `x`, the joined table has a row for each row in `y` that satisfies the join condition with that `x`-row.

For example:

- on the left, both `x` and `y` has keys `1` and `2`, so the resulting inner join contains a row for each of these two keys with all the remaining columns from the respective tables
- on the right, `x` has duplicate keys, so the matching rows from `y` are duplicated (if both tables have multiple keys, you get the cross product of the matching rows)


**[covering the example snippets]**

- `INNER JOIN` is the default join type that PostgreSQL uses, if you just type `JOIN`;
the keyword `ON` lets you match columns with qualified names (i.e. `table.colum`)
- the keyword `USING` can be used when the columns being matched have the same name in the two tables
- The `NATURAL` keyword is shorthand for `USING` all the common column names; if there are no common column names, it produces a cross join

---

## Qualified joins: OUTER JOIN

.left-balanced[
![:center 100%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/master/diagrams/join-outer.png)
]
.right-balanced[

```sql
-- left outer joins
SELECT * FROM x LEFT JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x LEFT OUTER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL LEFT JOIN y;
```

&lt;br/&gt;

```sql
-- right outer joins
SELECT * FROM x RIGHT JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x RIGHT OUTER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL RIGHT JOIN y;
```

&lt;br/&gt;

```sql
-- full outer joins
SELECT * FROM x FULL JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x FULL OUTER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL FULL JOIN y;
```

]

???

An `OUTER JOIN` takes all the rows for one or both of the source tables, depending on type, and adds missing values where the join condition was not met.

The `OUTER` keyword is completely optional, as it is already implied by the keywords `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL`.

- `LEFT JOIN`: all the rows of `x`, with the columns of `y` padded with `NULL` for non-matching keys
- `RIGHT JOIN`: same as left join, expect with the roles of `x` and `y` reversed
- `FULL JOIN`: all rows of both tables, with the columns of both padded with `NULL` whenever they have non-matching keys, respectively

---

## Qualified joins: alternative visual representation

![:center 75%](https://www.cmascenter.org/cost/images/join_types.png)

.footnote[(image source: [cmascenter.org](https://www.cmascenter.org/cost/sql_basics.html))]

???
Oftentimes in literature, you see the different types of joins represented as Venn diagrams, alluding to mathematical sets.

Think of these sets as sets of keys; different tables often have different colums, so the set interpretation doesn't make a lot of sense when considering whole rows

---
layout: true

## Useful joins without dedicated syntax

???
The semi join and the anti join do not have their own syntax in PostgreSQL.
Instead, the query planner may or may not use these joins for optimisation purposes (we will see an example of that in Lecture 04).

However, in R (`dplyr`), they _do_ have syntax, which we shall see in Lecture 03.

In _R for Data Science_, Hadley Wickham calls these types of joins _filtering joins_.

## Semi join

The semi join selects all rows from `x` that have a matching key in `y`, but without adding any data from `y`.

This can be achieved in PostgreSQL using a nested query, in which you simply identify the rows in `y` that have matching keys.
Notice the `SELECT 1 FROM y` line; the actual data selected from `y` doesn't matter, as it isn't used anyway, so you can select anything you want here (including `*`).

## Anti join

The anti join is the opposite of the semi join.
It selects all rows from `x` that do _not_ have a matching key in `y`.

---

.pull-left[

```sql
-- semi join
SELECT * FROM x
 WHERE EXISTS (
   SELECT 1 FROM y
    WHERE x.key = y.key
   );
```

   SELECT 1 FROM y
    WHERE x.key = y.key

## Subquery?

This inner query is an example of what's called a _subquery_. **[next slide]**

---
layout: false

name: subqueries
class: snowstorm, middle, center

# Subqueries

queries nested inside another query, enclosed in parentheses

???
A subquery is also called an _inner query_ or _inner select_.

Such an expression can be in many different cases:

- after a `FROM` clause in place of a table
- after a binary operator, if the subquery returns only one value
- after an array comparison function, if the subquery returns only one column

The last case is one you'll see often, so let's explore that a bit

---
layout: true

## Subquery expressions

---
.left-column[
### EXISTS
]

.right-column[

```sql
SELECT * FROM flights
 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM planes
                WHERE tailnum = flights.tailnum);
```

Selects the flights where the plane's tail number is recorded in the `planes` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM flights
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM planes
                    WHERE tailnum = flights.tailnum);
```

Selects the flights that do _not_ have a corresponding entry in the `planes` table
]

???
An `EXISTS` expression can be used to make semi and anti joins, as demonstrated on the previous slide.

Here is an example using the `nycflights13` data.

---
name: subquery-in

.left-column[
### EXISTS
### IN
]

.right-column[

```sql
SELECT * FROM flights
 WHERE tailnum IN (SELECT tailnum FROM planes
                    WHERE manufacturer = 'EMBRAER');
```

All the flights flown by a plane manufactured by EMBRAER

```sql
SELECT * FROM flights
 WHERE tailnum NOT IN (SELECT tailnum FROM planes
                        WHERE seats &lt; 50);
```

All the flights flown by larger planes (i.e. 50 or more seats)

]

???
An `IN` expression can for example be used to make a filtering join, where you condition on additionally filtered data from another table.

There is actually a subtle error on the slide; can you identify it?

➡️ the last sentence; in addition to all flights flown by larger planes, the second query will also return the ~50,000 flights flown by planes that don't have a corresponding entry in the `planes` table

---

.left-column[
### EXISTS
### IN
### ANY/SOME
]

.right-column[

```sql
SELECT * FROM airports
 WHERE alt &gt;= ANY (SELECT MAX(alt) FROM airports
                    GROUP BY tzone);
```

The airports that have an altitude higher or equal to the maximum altitude of any time zone.

The keyword `SOME` is an alias for `ANY`.

]

---

.left-column[
### EXISTS
### IN
### ANY/SOME
### ALL
]

.right-column[

```sql
SELECT * FROM airports
 WHERE alt &gt;= ALL (SELECT AVG(alt) FROM airports
                    GROUP BY tzone);
```

The airports that have an altitude higher or equal to _all_ the average altitudes by time zone.

## WITH queries

The `WITH` clause is used to build _common table expressions_ (CTE), which can be thought of as temporary tables that exists for just one query.

???
If you have a query with a lot of subqueries, it might be beneficial for organisational purposes to use CTEs, especially if you end up using a subquery multiple times.

Here is a (contrived) example to illustrate it;

---
---

```sql
WITH agg_tbl1 AS (SELECT AVG(dep_delay) AS avg_dep_delay,
			             AVG(air_time)  AS avg_air_time
	                FROM flights
	               GROUP BY origin
),
⁣
⁣
⁣
⁣
⁣
⁣
```

???
- The `WITH` clause goes before the `SELECT`; here, we define a temporary table called `agg_tbl1`, calculating the average `dep_delay` and `air_time` by `origin`.

    We can define as many of these as we like, separated by commas.

---

```sql
WITH agg_tbl1 AS (SELECT AVG(dep_delay) AS avg_dep_delay,
			             AVG(air_time)  AS avg_air_time
	                FROM flights
	               GROUP BY origin
), agg_tbl2 AS (SELECT MIN(avg_dep_delay) AS min_avg_dep_delay,
			           MIN(avg_air_time)  AS min_avg_air_time
	              FROM agg_tbl1
)
⁣
⁣
⁣
```

???
- The `WITH` clause goes before the `SELECT`; here, we define a temporary table called `agg_tbl1`, calculating the average `dep_delay` and `air_time` by `origin`.

    We can define as many of these as we like, separated by commas.

- After the comma, we define `agg_tbl2`, where we calculate the minimums of the quantities just calculated in `agg_tbl1`.

---

```sql
WITH agg_tbl1 AS (SELECT AVG(dep_delay) AS avg_dep_delay,
			             AVG(air_time)  AS avg_air_time
	                FROM flights
	               GROUP BY origin
), agg_tbl2 AS (SELECT MIN(avg_dep_delay) AS min_avg_dep_delay,
			           MIN(avg_air_time)  AS min_avg_air_time
	              FROM agg_tbl1
)
SELECT * FROM flights
 WHERE dep_delay &lt; (SELECT min_avg_dep_delay FROM agg_tbl2)
   AND air_time  &lt; (SELECT min_avg_air_time  FROM agg_tbl2);
```


The flights where both the delay on departure and air time are below all the averages by origin.

???

- The `WITH` clause goes before the `SELECT`; here, we define a temporary table called `agg_tbl1`, calculating the average `dep_delay` and `air_time` by `origin`.

    We can define as many of these as we like, separated by commas.

- After the comma, we define `agg_tbl2`, where we calculate the minimums of the quantities just calculated in `agg_tbl1`.

- Finally, the actual `SELECT` expression that brings it all together.

So what was the purpose of it?
Instead of having two subqueries, where we group by and summarise the `flights` data, we instead do it once and reference it twice, using a CTE.

# A word on NULLs

`NULL` is a special marker that indicates a value does not exist in the database.

???
The concept of nulls in SQL is similar to that of `NA` in R.

It is a marker of missingness, not a value in itself.

--

To test if a value is null:

- ❌ `value = NULL` (returns `NULL`)
- ✅ `value IS NULL` (similar to `is.na` in R)

???
Since it is a special marker, you need special syntax to test for nulls.

--

```sql
-- XOR join
SELECT *
  FROM x FULL JOIN y USING (key)
 WHERE x.key IS NULL
    OR y.key IS NULL;
```

???
An example where it can be used: an "XOR" join, i.e. the rows in `x` or `y`, where they don't have keys in common.

--

To control where nulls are placed when ordering a column:

- `ORDER BY col NULLS FIRST`
- `ORDER BY col NULLS LAST`
