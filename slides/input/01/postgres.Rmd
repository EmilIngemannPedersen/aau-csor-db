# PostgreSQL clients

# psql

```console
$ psql -h <hostname> -p <port> -U <user> -d <dbname>
```

By default, `hostname` is `localhost`, and `port` is 5432.

Command | Effect
--- | ---
`\d` | List tables in database
`\d table` | Describe table
`\l` | List databases on server
`\c dbname` | Connect to another database
`\e` | Open editor (e.g. for long, multi-line queries)
`\q` | Quit `psql`
`\?` | List all commands

Other than that, you can input SQL statements ― remember to end with `;`

???

`psql` is the command line tool for interacting with a PostgreSQL database.

We won't be using it in this course (other than for setting up the `postgres` user's password on Linux), but it you ever need to do some advanced shell scripting with PostgreSQL, it's good to know about.

# pgAdmin

???

`pgAdmin` is a graphical tool for managing your database, in which you get a tree-based view of the database structure.

This is what we'll be primarily using to interact with our local database.

**[switch to pgAdmin here to quickly showcase the most important functions]**

- Browser tree
- Query tool

[ensure everyone has it up and running with a `localhost` server]

---

## Set up example database

- Select `localhost` server in Browser
- Object → Create → Login/Group role
  - Name: `csor`
  - Password: `csor`
  - Privileges: default + can login, can create databases
- Object → Create → Database
  - Name: `nycflights13`
  - Owner: `csor`

Run this code in an R session:

```r
dbplyr::nycflights13_postgres(dbname = "nycflights13",
                              host = "localhost",
                              user = "csor",
                              password = "csor")
```

???

To get some example data into your `postgres` server, do these steps to add a database with a few tables.

---

## Run example queries


1. Select the `nycflights13` database in the Browser
2. Go to Tools → Query Tool
3. Run these queries individually (execute with F5)

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM airlines LIMIT 10;
    SELECT * FROM airports LIMIT 10;
    SELECT * FROM flights  LIMIT 10;
    SELECT * FROM planes   LIMIT 10;
    SELECT * FROM weather  LIMIT 10;
    ```

Try using `SELECT` and `WHERE` to retrieve different subsets, e.g.:

- the rows from `flight`, where `dep_delay` is 0
- the airlines whose `name` includes "Airlines"
- the `tailnum`s of all planes manufactured by "EMBRAER"
