# The R Notebook format

---

## What is it?

A special R Markdown output format

--

```md
---
title: "My R Notebook"
output: html_notebook
---

Content goes here...
```

--

In RStudio: File → New File → R Notebook

--

- Knits to self contained file (.nb.html)
- .Rmd file is embedded in the knitted file
- View chunk results inline (in RStudio)

---

## Using SQL connections

After the YAML header:

```{r con-yaml, eval=FALSE}
con <- dbConnect(...)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "con")
```

Notice that `con` is quoted in the second line.

--

After that, you can have SQL chunks with output, like so:

    ```⁣{sql}
    SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 10
    ```

--

You can also set the connection for individual chunks, like so:

    ```⁣{sql, connection = con}
    SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 10
    ```
