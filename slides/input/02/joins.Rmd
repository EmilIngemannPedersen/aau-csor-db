# Combining data from different tables

how to use the JOIN clause

## What is a join?

.pull-left[

`JOIN`: clause for combining relations.

.footnote[.pull-left[
In the examples in this section of the slides (which I've borrowed from [r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)), the tables used are:

- `x`, with columns: `key` and `val_x`
- `y`, with columns: `key` and `val_y`
]]
]

.pull-right[

```sql
x JOIN_TYPE y [ JOIN_CONDITION ]
```

An SQL `JOIN` clause is an instruction to combine columns from several tables in a database.

The code snippet should be read as:
"Join `x` and `y` together with `JOIN_TYPE` optionally conditioning on `JOIN_CONDITION`"

On the following slides, we'll look at the concrete `JOIN_TYPE` and `JOIN_CONDITION` you can use.
The figures for the different types of joins will use dots and lines to denote the data that will be returned.

## Cross join

`x CROSS JOIN y` `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` cartesian product of the rows in `x` and `y`

```sql
SELECT * FROM x CROSS JOIN y;

SELECT * FROM x, y;
```

If

- `x` has dimensions $n_x \times m_x$, and
- `y` has dimensions $n_y \times m_y$,

then their cross product has dimensions $n_x n_y \times (m_x + m_y)$

???

The official PostgreSQL documentation groups the types of joins into two:

- cross join
- qualified join

The `CROSS JOIN` between `x` and `y` is simply the table you get by taking all columns of both and return all possible combinations of rows

---

## Qualified joins

```sql
SELECT * FROM x { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN y ON boolean_expression;
SELECT * FROM x { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN y USING ( join column list );
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN y;
```

???

In contrast to the cross join, the _qualified joins_ only return rows from the two tables which are considering to be "matching", given some condition that evaluates to a boolean value.

The code snippet shown is from the documentation, and it should be read like this:

- For elements in braces `{ ... | ... }`, exactly one of the candidates (delimited by a `|`) must be present
- Elements in brackets `[ ... ]` are optional
- Each row in the snippet corresponds to a different way of specifying the join condition

---

## Qualified joins: INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT * FROM x JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x INNER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL JOIN y;
```

An `INNER JOIN` is the join that selects records found in both `x` and `y`.

That means, that for each row of `x`, the joined table has a row for each row in `y` that satisfies the join condition with that `x`-row.

For example:

- on the left, both `x` and `y` has keys `1` and `2`, so the resulting inner join contains a row for each of these two keys with all the remaining columns from the respective tables
- on the right, `x` has duplicate keys, so the matching rows from `y` are duplicated (if both tables have multiple keys, you get the cross product of the matching rows)


**[covering the example snippets]**

- `INNER JOIN` is the default join type that PostgreSQL uses, if you just type `JOIN`;
the keyword `ON` lets you match columns with qualified names (i.e. `table.colum`)
- the keyword `USING` can be used when the columns being matched have the same name in the two tables
- The `NATURAL` keyword is shorthand for `USING` all the common column names; if there are no common column names, it produces a cross join

## Qualified joins: OUTER JOIN

]
.right-balanced[

```sql
-- left outer joins
SELECT * FROM x LEFT JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x LEFT OUTER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL LEFT JOIN y;
```

<br/>

```sql
-- right outer joins
SELECT * FROM x RIGHT JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x RIGHT OUTER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL RIGHT JOIN y;
```

<br/>

```sql
-- full outer joins
SELECT * FROM x FULL JOIN y ON x.key = y.key;
SELECT * FROM x FULL OUTER JOIN y USING (key);
SELECT * FROM x NATURAL FULL JOIN y;
```

]

An `OUTER JOIN` takes all the rows for one or both of the source tables, depending on type, and adds missing values where the join condition was not met.

The `OUTER` keyword is completely optional, as it is already implied by the keywords `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL`.

- `LEFT JOIN`: all the rows of `x`, with the columns of `y` padded with `NULL` for non-matching keys
- `RIGHT JOIN`: same as left join, expect with the roles of `x` and `y` reversed
- `FULL JOIN`: all rows of both tables, with the columns of both padded with `NULL` whenever they have non-matching keys, respectively

Oftentimes in literature, you see the different types of joins represented as Venn diagrams, alluding to mathematical sets.

Think of these sets as sets of keys; different tables often have different colums, so the set interpretation doesn't make a lot of sense when considering whole rows

## Useful joins without dedicated syntax

???
The semi join and the anti join do not have their own syntax in PostgreSQL.
Instead, the query planner may or may not use these joins for optimisation purposes (we will see an example of that in Lecture 04).

However, in R (`dplyr`), they _do_ have syntax, which we shall see in Lecture 03.

In _R for Data Science_, Hadley Wickham calls these types of joins _filtering joins_.

## Semi join

The semi join selects all rows from `x` that have a matching key in `y`, but without adding any data from `y`.

This can be achieved in PostgreSQL using a nested query, in which you simply identify the rows in `y` that have matching keys.
Notice the `SELECT 1 FROM y` line; the actual data selected from `y` doesn't matter, as it isn't used anyway, so you can select anything you want here (including `*`).

## Anti join

The anti join is the opposite of the semi join.
It selects all rows from `x` that do _not_ have a matching key in `y`.

## Subquery?

This inner query is an example of what's called a _subquery_. **[next slide]**
