# Summarising data

computing a single result from a set of input values

???

To summarise data means to calculate aggregate results from many rows into few or a single row.

---

## What is a summary?

```sql
 SELECT summary_function(expr) [AS new_name] [, ... ] FROM table
[ GROUP BY grouping_variables ]
```

.pull-left[

A _summary function_ aggregates a set of values into one single value (summary)

]

.pull-right[

Use the `GROUP BY` clause to create summaries on a by-group basis

???
More often than not, you don't want to pull out data as-is from your database, but rather calculate some summaries exposing some insight.

The basic syntax for that is as shown: in the column list of `SELECT`, you make calls to so-called _summary functions_, optionally grouping the input values by one or more variables.

## Summary functions

.pull-left[
- `count(*)`: the number of input rows
- `count(expr)`: the number of rows where `expr` is not null
- `avg(expr)`: the average of the input values
- `sum(expr)`: the sum of the input values
- `max(expr)`: the maximum input value
- `min(expr)`: the minimum input value
]

.pull-right[
- `bool_and(expr)`: true if all input values are true
- `bool_or(expr)`: true if at least one input value is true
- `corr(Y, X)`: correlation coefficient between X and Y
- `stddev(expr)`: standard deviation of input values
- `variance(expr)`: variance of input values
]

Many more are available, see the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)

Here is a quick overview of some of the summary functions that you'll likely need to use.

Many more are available.

## Filtering on summaries: the HAVING clause

- `WHERE`: filter using a condition on individual rows, before grouping
- `HAVING`: filter using a condition on aggregations, after grouping

???
When you work with grouped data, you may wish to filter on either individual rows or groups.
The `WHERE` clause, which you saw last time, does the former, and the `HAVING` clause does the latter.

--

```sql
SELECT carrier, count(*) FROM flights
 WHERE origin = 'JFK'
 GROUP BY carrier
HAVING min(distance) > 1000;
```

The carriers whose flights from JFK airport all fly at least 1000 miles to reach their destinations, and their respective number of flights

???
Here is a small example of the usage of `HAVING`.

--

Syntax rule of thumb:

- `WHERE` goes _before_ `GROUP BY` (filter before grouping)
- `HAVING` goes _after_ `GROUP BY` (filter after grouping)
