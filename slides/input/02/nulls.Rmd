# A word on NULLs

`NULL` is a special marker that indicates a value does not exist in the database.

???
The concept of nulls in SQL is similar to that of `NA` in R.

It is a marker of missingness, not a value in itself.

--

To test if a value is null:

- `r emo::ji("x")` `value = NULL` (returns `NULL`)
- `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `value IS NULL` (similar to `is.na` in R)

???
Since it is a special marker, you need special syntax to test for nulls.

--

```sql
-- XOR join
SELECT *
  FROM x FULL JOIN y USING (key)
 WHERE x.key IS NULL
    OR y.key IS NULL;
```

???
An example where it can be used: an "XOR" join, i.e. the rows in `x` or `y`, where they don't have keys in common.

To control where nulls are placed when ordering a column:

- `ORDER BY col NULLS FIRST`
- `ORDER BY col NULLS LAST`
