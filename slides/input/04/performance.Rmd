# Performance

analyzing queries and boosting performance with indexes

---

## EXPLAIN ANALYZE

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM flights
 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM planes
                WHERE tailnum = flights.tailnum)
   AND origin = 'JFK';
```

In pgAdmin: type in a query (without `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) and hit F7

## Indexes

Stored information about the sorting of a column, speeds up `WHERE` clauses.

  * Can be created for single or multiple columns
  * Speedup gained when using all indexed columns (with `WHERE` and `AND`)
  * Indexes can be unique (but doesn't have to be)
  * Primary keys
    * Implies non-`NULL` unique index

--

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name
  USING btree
  (col1, col2, ...);
```

???
This is the syntax for creating an index in SQL.

  * `USING` algorithm can be one of several, usually `btree` is best choice
  * One or more columns to index in the list

## Motivating example

In `testdb`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE huge_data_table AS
  SELECT s, round(s/10000, 0) AS s_round
    FROM generate_series(1, 10000000) s;
```

--

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  SELECT AVG(s)
  FROM huge_data_table
  WHERE s_round = 10;
```

--

```sql
CREATE INDEX s_round_index
  ON huge_data_table
  USING btree
  (s_round);
```

## Exercise

In the `nycflights13` database:

  * Create a copy of `flights` without indexes:

  ```sql
  SELECT * INTO flights_noindex FROM flights;
  ```

  * Look up the indexes on `flights`; both via pgAdmin and using the catalog:

  ```sql
  SELECT tablename, indexname, indexdef
    FROM pg_indexes
   WHERE tablename = 'flights';
  ```

  * Come up with some queries whose query plan are different when running them on `flights` and `flights_noindex`, respectively
