# A closer look at PostgreSQL databases

???
In this section we will take another look at the components of a database, and how to work with them from an administrating point of view.

We'll set up a new database, look at how to organise it, define and populate tables for different users, all with SQL code.

---

## SQL is more than queries: `CREATE`

???
Until now, we've been using either pgAdmin or R to create objects on our PostgreSQL server.

Both ways, under the hood, are eventually reduced to SQL `CREATE` calls.

--

```sql
CREATE DATABASE name
    [ [ WITH ] [ OWNER [=] user_name ]
           [ TEMPLATE [=] template ]
           [ ENCODING [=] encoding ]
           [ LC_COLLATE [=] lc_collate ]
           [ LC_CTYPE [=] lc_ctype ]
           [ TABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name ]
           [ ALLOW_CONNECTIONS [=] allowconn ]
           [ CONNECTION LIMIT [=] connlimit ]
           [ IS_TEMPLATE [=] istemplate ] ]
```

???
This is the full syntax for creating a new database in PostgreSQL.

  * As usual, bracketed expressions are optional
  * Usually, the defaults are fine

--

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb
  WITH
  OWNER = csor;
```

???
Let's create a new database for this lecture (we'll delete it again later).

  * Set `OWNER` to `csor` and keep the rest at the defaults (by not specifying values)
  * In pgAdmin, if it's not showing up yet, select Databases and go to Object â†’ Refresh

## Overview of a database

???
So far, we've just been working with tables, but a PostgreSQL database is comprised of many things.

Since we won't be using most of them, I'll just sprint through the list, so consider this a shallow overview.

Contents of a PostgreSQL database:

  * **Casts**: specifications of how to convert between types
  * **Catalogs**: database metadata tables
  * **Event triggers**: automatic commands triggered by certain events
  * **Extensions**: plugins for PostgreSQL
  * **Foreign data wrappers**: methods to query external sources
  * **Languages**: procedural languages used to write user-defined functions
  * **Schemas**: collections of objects for organising data
]

???

  * Casts are functions for converting between types (can be useful if you e.g. define your own Types)
  * Catalogs contain metadata about your database. In one of the exercises, you'll try querying information from the catalog
  * Event triggers are commands that are executed automatically on certain "events"
  * Extensions are plugins that extend the functionality of the database
  * Foreign data wrappers lets you create so-called _foreign tables_ that are proxies for some other data source - it can be a flat file, or even another SQL database. Querying against such a table makes the FDW query the external source and return results as if it came from a table in your database
  * Languages are programming languages for writing functions, they need to be declared. PostgreSQL has its own, PL/pgSQL, but you can also use popular general purpose languages like Perl, Python, and of course C
  * Schemas can be thought of as similar to system file folders (except they can't be nested)

.right-balanced[
Contents of a _schema_:

  * **Collations**: sort order specifications
  * **Domains**: custom types with constraints
  * **FTS**: full text search related objects
  * **Foreign tables**: external data sources
  * **Functions**: user defined functions
  * **Materialized Views**: views stored as tables
  * **Sequences**: sequential number generators
  * **Tables**: collections of records
  * **Trigger functions**: automatically invoked functions
  * **Types**: custom types
  * **Views**: saved queries
]

???

  * Collations define sort orders for strings, and different such orders exists, e.g. for accented characters
  * Domains are like Types, except they have constraints; this can be useful to use instead of repeating constraints on different tables
  * FTS is used for more performant string searching (we won't be covering this though)
  * Foreign tables are objects used to query data sources that are not on the PostgreSQL server itself
  * Materialized views are Views that are stored as tables (more on this later)
  * Sequences are usually used for unique identifiers for rows in tables
  * Tables is where your data lives
  * Trigger functions are special functions that are invoked whenever an event associated with a table occurs (event triggers act more "globally")
  * Types are custom types, usually composite types (i.e. types composed of several primitive types)
  * Views are basically queries that are saved and can be used in place of tables (more on this later)
