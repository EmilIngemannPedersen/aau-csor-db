# Views

queries saved server-side

## What is a View?

--

  * Another way to present data from the database

--

  * Based on one or more tables

--

  * A query with an assigned name

---

## Create a view

```sql
SET ROLE alice;
CREATE VIEW balance AS (
  SELECT account,
         sum(amount) AS balance
    FROM transactions
   GROUP BY account
);
```

You know the drill - repeat with Bob in pgAdmin.

## Materialized views

More like actual tables - needs to be refreshed when the source gets updated.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW matbalance AS (
  SELECT account,
         sum(amount) AS balance
    FROM transactions
   GROUP BY account
);
```

Same as the regular view.

  * Try selecting from both to confirm they return the same data
  * Add a row to `transactions`
  * Select from both again. What's different now?

Materialized views must be updated with

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW matbalance;
```
